We don't want to reinvent the wheel. We already have all the infrastructure we need to make a better world. I realized 14 years ago, that 90% of the infrastructure we needed had already been invented. We look to the future, and ignore the people who are triyn gto improve things. What we need is curation and promotion. I've collected a list of 20 apps and projects which I think will help. I took care to make it 20 apps, not 200, because 200 is too many. 

Our future as a collective species literally depends on our choice of software.

So what is my job, if the infastucture has already been built.

1) Promote other projects, 
2) Help people raise their first 500USD, adn set up an open source microfinacne network. 

Food and deliveries.
