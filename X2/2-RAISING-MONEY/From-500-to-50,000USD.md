If you want to raise 50,000 for a dream, first raise 500, or even 50. Then prove yourself with that. 

We are actively courting donors right now. They're helpful people, but they're not stupid. 

- They need to see an accurately costed project. 
- They need so see you've worked hard on your own, to make it happen. 
- Before they donate 5 thousand, they want you to prove yourself with 500, or 50 USD.

Im surprised at the amount of people who laugh at smaller amounts of money, then stay surprised that no one will invest in, or donate to them.
