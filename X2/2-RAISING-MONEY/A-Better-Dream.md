## A Better Dream

Earth is a dystopian chiller. Can we change the sript, and make it a romantic comedy?

Im working towards a world where each house can partially, and then fully supply its own drinking, then washing and showering water.

I propose we drastically increase our intake of chlorophyll rich foods, such as barleygrass, spinach and swiss chard.
