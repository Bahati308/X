# Secret Foundations

## [Printable Version](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BK2_l6_fyYJUigEiGLfjJ781S7GP-TAyqaecurI0v7c/edit)

We are trying to make contact with secret finance foundations that exist in Asia, Europe, and elsewhere. They have billion dollar funds 
that can be used to clean the environment, provide well paid work for Taiwanese people, and build new towns. 

These secret foundations never advertize, are very secretive and difficult to contact. 

To successfully receive donations them, we need to fulfill three criteria:

- Set up a microfinance software network on the surface of the Earth.
- Set up pilot projects (for example beach-cleaning, tree-planting etc)
- Teach people how to use open source software. 

You can help us by:

- Answering these questions on video.
- Visiting this page.
