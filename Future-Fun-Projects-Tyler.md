## Make a DIY Flanagan Neurophone, a brain enhancing device. (FUN/PAID)

### PARTS LIST

### HARDWARE

- 5 Piezo Pickups
- TL 494 Pulese Width Moduolation controller. 

### SOFTWARE 
- Connect a sine wave signal generator to the input. (If you don't have a signal generator, generate a 440Hz sine wave in the open-source Audacity music editor and upload the file to an MP3 player.

## Instructables Design Looks Simplest So Far. 



NOTES:

- Also, it turns out "earplug-style" in-ear-monitor headphones produce some of (but probably not all) of the same effects a Neurophone does. 
- By mixing an audio signal with ultrasound, you can hear the audio as if it's inside your head... even if the 'headphones' are nowhere near your ears.
- The second version of the "Neurophone" used ultrasound instead. By modulating an ultrasonic signal with the audio we want to listen to, it gets picked up by a little-known part of the brain and turned into something that feels like sound.
- TL494 pulse-width modulation controller. 


The weird thing is this works even if the ultrasound transducers are far away from the head: maybe down at your waist, or even further (depending on your body).
