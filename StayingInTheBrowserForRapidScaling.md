I realized this to my cost a couple of years back, when I spent entire weekends trying to deploy buggy Ruby on Rails sites on Digital Ocean. The bugs were my fault. Nothing against that framework. Same with Elixir/Phoenix, same with NodeJS.

Whatever framework you use, only 1 to 3% of people are going to have the patience to deploy a site on a digital ocean droplet. 

[b]On the other hand...[/b]

If you stick with HTML/CSS/JS, and keep the code in a single, copypastable pane, and use other people's APIs... the site becomes very easy to copy, allowing for more rapid scaling. 

There are hundreds of free or low-cost usable APIs out there. Or you could just make a wrapper site that links through to whatever project you're trying to promote. 

Staying in the browser has it's downsides, but many more benefits. You don't need to run a server, and can deploy a site for free.
